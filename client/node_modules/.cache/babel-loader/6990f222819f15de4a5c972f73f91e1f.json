On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ultra-conservatives with extreme views to dinner to do the same to them'? Several dinner parties and deaths later, they think they've hit the jackpot when they meet powerful ultra-conservative broadcaster Norman Arbuthnot, who they invite for dinner. But the friends' plans start to unravel when they can't agree on whether certain of their guests deserve to die. It is also threatened by Sheriff Alice Stanley, who is not looking for the five's victims, but is nevertheless nosing around as she works on a missing girl case.\",\n      \"Language\": \"English\",\n      \"Country\": \"USA\",\n      \"Awards\": \"1 win & 1 nomination.\",\n      \"Poster\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Metascore\": \"N/A\",\n      \"imdbRating\": \"6.8\",\n      \"imdbVotes\": \"12,208\",\n      \"imdbID\": \"tt0113613\",\n      \"Type\": \"movie\",\n      \"Response\": \"True\"\n    }, {\n      \"Title\": \"Switched!\",\n      \"Year\": \"2003–2004\",\n      \"Rated\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Released\": \"26 May 2003\",\n      \"Runtime\": \"30 min\",\n      \"Genre\": \"Family\",\n      \"Director\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Writer\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Actors\": \"Cindy Oliver, Cody Oliver, James Oliver, Younger Oliver\",\n      \"Plot\": \"2 teens from different cities in the US are given a chance to swap lives to see how the other one lives.\",\n      \"Language\": \"English\",\n      \"Country\": \"USA\",\n      \"Awards\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Poster\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Metascore\": \"N/A\",\n      \"imdbRating\": \"6.6\",\n      \"imdbVotes\": \"49\",\n      \"imdbID\": \"tt0372727\",\n      \"Type\": \"series\",\n      \"totalSeasons\": \"2\",\n      \"Response\": \"True\"\n    }, {\n      \"Title\": \"Dastaan\",\n      \"Year\": \"2010–\",\n      \"Rated\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Released\": \"26 Jun 2010\",\n      \"Runtime\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Genre\": \"Drama\",\n      \"Director\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Writer\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Actors\": \"Sanam Baloch, Ahsan Khan, Fawad Khan, Saba amar\",\n      \"Plot\": \"Bano and her fiance face the trials and tribulations caused by the 1947 Indian partition.\",\n      \"Language\": \"Urdu\",\n      \"Country\": \"Pakistan\",\n      \"Awards\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Poster\": \"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BZTI4OWNhYTgtMjgwZi00MjE2LThiZTYtYTZkZDNkOGUxYTgyXkEyXkFcGdeXVyMzc0NzU5MTc@._V1_SX300.jpg\",\n      \"Metascore\": \"N/A\",\n      \"imdbRating\": \"8.4\",\n      \"imdbVotes\": \"260\",\n      \"imdbID\": \"tt2404721\",\n      \"Type\": \"series\",\n      \"totalSeasons\": \"N/A\",\n      \"Response\": \"True\"\n    }, {\n      \"Title\": \"Les visiteurs\",\n      \"Year\": \"1993\",\n      \"Rated\": \"R\",\n      \"Released\": \"12 Jul 1996\",\n      \"Runtime\": \"107 min\",\n      \"Genre\": \"Comedy, Fantasy, Sci-Fi\",\n      \"Director\": \"Jean-Marie Poiré\",\n      \"Writer\": \"Christian Clavier, Jean-Marie Poiré\",\n      \"Actors\": \"Christian Clavier, Jean Reno, Valérie Lemercier, Marie-Anne Chazel\",\n      \"Plot\": \"A medieval nobleman and his suire are accidentally transported to contemporary times by a senile sorcerer.

This behavior is typical for Yvonne as she was the cause of Duval and Celeste's marriage breaking up. Jimmy is implicated as the culprit when Yvonne is found strangled to death, as Mac, the security guard, overheard Jimmy state that he would strangle Yvonne. In reality, Jimmy said that to Peggy in jest to appease her jealousy. Beyond all the employees at the fashion house, other people who are brought in for uestioning by the police are: Mr. Davis, Yvonne's older wealthy boyfriend; and snobbish and condescending customer Jessica Van Allen and her henpecked husband Harvey Van Allen, the last two customers in the store before closing when Yvonne was murdered. All the models detest Mrs. Van Allen, who they criticized to her face on that last visit. Despite their issues, Peggy is certain Jimmy did not kill Yvonne. As Jimmy and Peggy try to clear Jimmy's name by finding the real killer, they come to believe Yvonne's death has something to do with an expensive diamond brooch Davis bought for Yvonne. But as they progress in their investigation, Peggy and Jimmy come across one dead body after another, which further implicates Peggy as Jimmy's accomplice. Their only hope is that Marie can remember the name of the man Yvonne muttered shortly before her murder.

Every Sunday for the past year, they have hosted a dinner party, inviting a friend over to have an open-minded discussion about whatever topics are of interest. On a dark and stormy night when Pete was supposed to bring a friend for one of those dinners, he instead comes home with Zachary Cody, who rescued a stranded Pete whose car broke down. They invite Zach to stay for dinner instead of Pete's missing friend. They soon find out that Zach is among other things a racist neo-Nazi, which brings up a potentially dangerous situation for Jewish Marc and black Luke. After some physical altercations and verbal threats, Marc ends up stabbing Zach dead out of what he considers self-defense. As the friends discuss what to do about Zach, they finally come to the conclusion that in killing Zach, they have done society a service. So they ponder 'why not invite other ultra-conservatives with extreme views to dinner to do the same to them'? Several dinner parties and deaths later, they think they've hit the jackpot when they meet powerful ultra-conservative broadcaster Norman Arbuthnot, who they invite for dinner. But the friends' plans start to unravel when they can't agree on whether certain of their guests deserve to die.
